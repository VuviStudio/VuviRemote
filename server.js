# VuviRemote

A high-performance remote desktop control solution built with Node.js and WebSocket technology. Control your Windows PC through any browser with low-latency screen sharing, keyboard/mouse control, and audio streaming capabilities.

## Features
- Ultra-low latency screen sharing
- Multi-monitor support with dynamic, glassy UI
- Full keyboard and mouse control (including multi-screen cursor)
- Audio streaming (if FFmpeg is available)
- Modern, elegant, and responsive web interface

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/VuviStudio/VuviRemote.git
   cd VuviRemote
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Install FFmpeg (for audio streaming):**
   - Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org/download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
   - Extract the archive and place the folder in your project root as `ffmpeg/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl/`
   - The executable should be at: `ffmpeg/ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl/bin/ffmpeg.exe`
   - _If you only want screen sharing and input, you can skip this step._
4. **Start the server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
5. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000` on any device in your network.

## Remote Access (LocalTunnel)
To access your server from anywhere, you can use [localtunnel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel):

1. Start a tunnel (replace `dmain` with your preferred subdomain):
   ```sh
   npx localtunnel --port 3000 --subdomain dmain
   ```
2. You'll get a public URL like `https://ytcuh.loca.lt` to access your server remotely.

**Note:**
- LocalTunnel is for quick, temporary remote access. For production, use a VPN or reverse proxy with authentication.
